      <article class="amy_work"><h1>Assistant to PHD student</h1> <h2>(IIT Patna February 2019 - April 2019)</h2>
       Helped write a paper on Transfer learning which was submitted to the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2019 titled Unied Framework for Domain Adaptation on Manifolds.Helped test the model against other standard models and tune parameters to optimise the model.</article>
      <article class="amy_work"><h1>Part-Time Intern at Sesame Software Solutions</h1> <h2> (Kozhikode, India May 2020 - July 2020)</h2>
        Was part of a team which modeled an Early Warning system for banks which facilitates them in
        identifying personals having a high risk of defaulting. The work included analysis of customer data,
        finding relevant features and producing a generalised model.</article>
      <article class="amy_work"><h1>Predicting a Pulsar Star</h1>
        Pulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission detectable here on Earth.Each
        pulsar produces different emission pattern. Using the parameters obtained from the emission spectrum
        was able to train the HTRU2 data set against various standard classification models. HTRU2 is a data
        set which describes a sample of pulsar candidates collected during the High Time Resolution Universe
        Survey .The highest accuracy achieved after hyper-parameter tuning was 97.8% (SVM model).</article>
